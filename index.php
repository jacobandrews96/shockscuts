<h1>Shocks Cuts Calendar of availability</h1>
<p>All of the slots that you see marked as busy, means that I can't cut then! I recommend you click the 'week' tab on the top right and submit the time slots that work for you when I don't have anything planned!</p>

<p>If there are any time conflicts or you need a cut that will definitely last longer than 30 minutes please call or text me at INSERT PHONE NUMBER</p>
